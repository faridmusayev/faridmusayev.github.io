## Summary

Soccer is a low scoring game. Thus, it appears hard to evaluate performance of teams
looking only at the number of scored and conceded goals. In comparison to goals,
teams usually execute a much higher number of shots. However, not all of those shots
are of the same quality. In other words, different shots may have different probabilities
of being scored. These probabilities may depend on many different parameters. In this
project, I would to implement Expected Goals Model that computes how likely is a given shot
to result into a goal.


## Implementation

The project consists of the following parts:

* [Part 1 | Data Preprocessing](data_preprocessing.ipynb)

  In this section, I demonstrate how to extract data from external resource,
  filter out only required competitions, specify the columns of interest and
  bring them into desirable format.

* [Part 2 | Building Model](building_model.ipynb)

  This part mainly focuses on the exploratory data analysis, design of new
  features and statistical analysis of existing ones, splitting and transforming
  data, hyperparameter tuning and model selection.
