## Swedish Football Analytics

In this [visualization](xG_for_against_subplots.ipynb),
 I make a gridplot of xG values conceded and scored by each team against all other teams
 in Allsvenskan (Swedish Top Football League)
during season 2021. Since this is a gridplot, one can obtain only a general
performance overview for each of the teams without going into details. This gridplot was
designed using object-oriented plotting in `matplotlib`.
