## Allsvenskan 2021

In this visualization,
 I make a gridplot of xG values conceded and scored by each team against all other teams
 in Allsvenskan (Swedish Top Football League)
during season 2021. Since this is a gridplot, one can obtain only a general
performance overview for each team. This gridplot was
designed using object-oriented plotting in [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/).

Code is available [here.](xG_for_against_subplots.ipynb)
