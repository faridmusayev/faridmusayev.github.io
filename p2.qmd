## Allsvenskan 2021

In this visualization,
 I make a gridplot of xG values conceded and scored by each team against all other teams
 in Allsvenskan (Swedish Top Football League)
during season 2021. Since this is a gridplot, one can obtain only a general
performance overview for each of the teams. This gridplot was
designed using object-oriented plotting in [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/).

Code is available [here.](xG_for_against_subplots.ipynb)

## Gibbs Sampling Convergence
This is a visualization of two parameters, variance and mean, which
were simulated from their respective conditional posterior distributions until convergence. The upper
plots show the trajectories of sampled Markov Chains. The lower plots show the number of iterations
required to reach convergence for each parameter. This plot was designed using [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).

Code is available [here.](https://github.com/faridmusayev/data_visualization/blob/main/gibbs/gibb_sampling.R)

## MCMC Convergence of Parameters
In this visualization, MCMC algorithm is used to draw parameters of Poisson regression
from multivariate posterior distribution. After approximately 250 iterations, parameters
start to converge. This plot was designed using [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).

Code is available [here.](https://github.com/faridmusayev/data_visualization/blob/main/mcmc/MCMC.R)

This plot was created in collaboration with Kristina Levina.
