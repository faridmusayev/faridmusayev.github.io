## Gibbs Sampling Convergence
This is a visualization of two parameters, variance and mean, which
were sampled from their respective conditional posterior distributions until convergence. The upper
plots show the trajectories of sampled Markov Chains. The lower plots show the number of iterations
required to reach convergence for each parameter. This plot was designed using [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).

Code is available [here.](https://github.com/faridmusayev/data_visualization/blob/main/gibbs/gibb_sampling.R) or [here](gibbs_plot.qmd).

## MCMC Convergence of Parameters
In this visualization, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is used to draw parameters of Poisson regression
from a multivariate posterior distribution. After approximately 250 iterations, the parameters
start to converge. This plot was designed using [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).
