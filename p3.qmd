### Approximation of sin(x) function with Gaussian Kernel
In this visualization, Gaussian Kernel model is implemented to approximate values of a
given  function sin(x). In other words, for a given range of x values, Gaussian Kernel model
allows to predict values of sin(x). It can be oberved that approximated and  sin(x)
values are very close to each other. This plot was designed using [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).

### Gibbs Sampling Convergence
This is a visualization of two parameters, variance and mean, which
were sampled from their respective conditional posterior distributions until convergence. The upper
plots show the trajectories of sampled Markov Chains. The lower plots show the number of iterations
required to reach convergence for each parameter. This plot was designed using [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).

Code is available [here.](https://github.com/faridmusayev/data_visualization/blob/main/gibbs/gibb_sampling.R)

This plot was created in collaboration with [Kristina Levina](https://github.com/Ada-Lev/Data-Visualisation).

### MCMC Convergence of Parameters
In this visualization, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is used to draw parameters of Poisson regression
from a multivariate posterior distribution. After approximately 250 iterations, the parameters
start to converge. This plot was designed using [`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).
